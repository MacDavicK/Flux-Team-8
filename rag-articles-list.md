## Chunking Recommendations for RAG

Based on RAG chunking best practices for your custom FastAPI + vector DB stack:

### Chunk Configuration
1. **Chunk size**: 400-600 tokens with 50-100 token overlap
2. **Method**: Hierarchical/recursive splitting at section boundaries (preserve headings)
3. **Strategy**: Use semantic boundaries (sections, paragraphs) rather than fixed character counts

### Metadata Tagging
Add these metadata fields to each chunk:
- `source`: Original document title/URL
- `category`: weight_loss | nutrition | strength | cardio | behavioral
- `authority_level`: government | peer_reviewed | reputable_health_org
- `region`: global | US | UK | Australia
- `content_type`: guideline | research | practical_guide

### Collection Strategy
Consider separate vector collections by category for more targeted retrieval:
- `weight_loss_collection`
- `nutrition_collection`
- `strength_training_collection`
- `cardio_collection`
- `behavioral_collection`

Or use a unified collection with category-based filtering in your retrieval queries.

### Implementation Notes
- Preserve markdown headers in chunks to maintain context
- Store article URL and citation info in metadata for attribution
- Index both the chunk text and the metadata fields
- Consider embedding article titles separately for semantic search over source documents
